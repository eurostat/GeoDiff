# GeoDiff format

These are the specifications of the GeoDiff format.

The GeoDiff format represents differences between versions of a vector geospatial dataset. GeoDiff data can be used to represent updates of a dataset. It is assumed that the dataset structure does not change between the two versions; only the content changes. The type of changes supported are thus:
- Insertion of features
- Deletion of features 
- Changes of features (geometries and/or attribute values)
